# AI Prompts Used

I used ChatGPT to help with:
- **Project structure** — how to set up `src/org/howard/edu/lsp/assignment3` and the `doc` folder.
- **Refactoring** — splitting one ETLPipeline class into Extractor, Transformer, Loader, and ETLMain.
- **Troubleshooting compile/run errors** — fixing package names, main method issues, and classpath.

Example prompts I used:
- "What should go inside `Extractor.java` for reading a CSV?"
- "How to fix 'Main method not found in class ETLMain'?"
- "What do I write in REFLECTION.md and AI_PROMPTS.md for this assignment?"
